# Speedrun.com-API-access-through-R
 
This repository includes a few functions that can be run in R to collect data from speedrun.com, a website where people record their attempts to complete video games as fast as possible. To properly run the code, you should have an account with speedrun.com. You will need the API key that each user is assigned.
Also, keep in mind that there is an API call cap of about 100 per minute. The functions in this repository have built in delays, to help ensure that no application of the code could negatively impact the site.
